# 👋 Welcome to HTML!

HTML is like the skeleton of every website! It tells your browser what to show on the page.

## 🎯 Your First HTML

Let's make something appear on the screen!

```html livecodes height=6lh
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>I just wrote my first HTML! 🎉</p>
```

**Try it!** Click the ▶️ button to see your code come to life!

## 💡 What's Happening?

- `<h1>` = Big heading (like a title)
- `<p>` = Paragraph (regular text)
- Those `< >` things? They're called **tags**!

Tags wrap around your content like a hug 🤗

## 🚀 Your Turn!

Use the editor on the right to complete this challenge!

1. Copy the code below into the editor.
2. Change `_____` to your name.
3. Click **Run** to see your code.
4. Click **Submit** when you're done!

```html livecodes mode=codeblock height=4lh
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>My name is _____ and I'm learning HTML!</p>
```
