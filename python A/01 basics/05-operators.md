# Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

## Arithmetic Operators

Used for math.

| Operator | Name           | Example  | Result (if x=10, y=3) |
| :------- | :------------- | :------- | :-------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition       | `x + y`  | `13`                  |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | `x - y`  | `7`                   |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `x * y`  | `30`                  |
| `/`      | Division       | `x / y`  | `3.333...`            |
| `//`     | Floor Division | `x // y` | `3` (rounds down)     |
| `%`      | Modulus        | `x % y`  | `1` (remainder)       |
| `**`     | Exponentiation | `x ** y` | `1000` ($10^3$)       |

## Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values. They return a Boolean (`True` or `False`).

| Operator | Meaning                  | Example            |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :----------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `5 == 5` is `True` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             | `5 != 3` is `True` |
| `>`      | Greater than             | `5 > 3` is `True`  |
| `<`      | Less than                | `5 < 3` is `False` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `5 >= 5` is `True` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `4 <= 5` is `True` |

### Try It Yourself

Calculate the area of a rectangle with `width = 5` and `height = 10` using the `*` operator.
