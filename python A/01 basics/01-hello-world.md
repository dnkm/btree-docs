# Hello World

Welcome to your first Python program! In this lesson, we will learn how to print text to the screen.

## The `print()` Function

To display text in Python, we use the `print()` function. Text must be enclosed in quotes (either single `'` or double `"`).

### Example

```python static
print("Hello, World!")
---
Hello, World!
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Missing quotes**: `print(Hello)` will cause an error because Python thinks `Hello` is a variable.
- **Capital P**: Python is case-sensitive. `Print("...")` will not work; it must be `print`.
