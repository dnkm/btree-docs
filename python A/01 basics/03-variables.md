# Variables

Variables are like containers for storing data values. In Python, a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

## Creating Variables

You create a variable by giving it a name and assigning a value using the `=` sign.

### Example

```python
message = "Hello, Python!"
score = 100
pi = 3.14
```

Here:

- `message` stores text (string).
- `score` stores a whole number (integer).
- `pi` stores a decimal number (float).

## Naming Rules

- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- They **cannot** start with a number.
- They are **case-sensitive** (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are different variables).
- Use descriptive names (e.g., `student_name` instead of `x`).

### Try It Yourself

Create variables for your `name`, `age`, and `school`, then print them out.
