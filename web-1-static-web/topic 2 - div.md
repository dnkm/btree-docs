# 🏗️ Meet the Mighty `<div>` Tag

Welcome to Topic 2! Let’s dive into one of the most important building blocks of HTML: the `<div>` tag. Think of it as a **box** to organize your content. 🛠️

A quick example,

```html
<div>My books: ...</div>
<div>My clothes: ...</div>
<div>My favorite snacks: ...</div>
```

Without `<div>` tags, your content would be a chaotic mess! 🎈

## Nesting `<div>` Tags

You can even put `<div>` tags inside other `<div>` tags to create sections within sections. For example:

```html
<div>
  <div>Books I’ve Read:</div>
  <div>
    <div>Harry Potter</div>
    <div>The Hobbit</div>
    <div>To Kill a Mockingbird</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This makes it easier to organize and style your content later.

## Why Use `<div>`?

- **Keeps things organized**
- **Helps with styling**
- **Allows for nesting**

That’s it for now! In the next chapters, we’ll learn how to make these `<div>` tags look amazing using Tailwind CSS. 🚀
