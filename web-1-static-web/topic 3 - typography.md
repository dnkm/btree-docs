# ðŸŽ¨ Styling with Tailwind CSS

Welcome to Topic 3! Now that youâ€™ve mastered the `<div>` tag, itâ€™s time to make it look awesome. Weâ€™ll use a super popular library called **Tailwind CSS** to style our HTML. Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€

## Why Use Tailwind CSS?

In web development, **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to add styles to HTML. For example, you can change fonts, adjust spacing, or make things bold. Hereâ€™s a quick example of CSS:

```html
<div style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Hello World</div>
```

But writing CSS like this for every element can get **tedious** and **time-consuming**. Thatâ€™s where **Tailwind CSS** comes in! Itâ€™s a library that gives you pre-made classes to style your HTML quickly and easily.

## Basic Typography Classes

Letâ€™s learn some basic Tailwind CSS classes to style text inside a `<div>` tag. These classes are super easy to useâ€”just add them to your HTML elements.

### 1. Font Size

Control the size of your text with classes like `text-sm`, `text-lg`, and more:

```html
<div class="text-sm">This is small text</div>
<div class="text-lg">This is large text</div>
<div class="text-2xl">This is extra-large text</div>
```

### 2. Font Weight

Make your text bold or light with classes like `font-bold` and `font-light`:

```html
<div class="font-light">This is light text</div>
<div class="font-bold">This is bold text</div>
<div class="font-extrabold">This is extra-bold text</div>
```

### 3. Text Alignment

Align your text to the left, center, or right with classes like `text-left`, `text-center`, and `text-right`:

```html
<div class="text-left">This text is aligned to the left</div>
<div class="text-center">This text is centered</div>
<div class="text-right">This text is aligned to the right</div>
```

### 4. Line Height

Adjust the spacing between lines of text with classes like `leading-none` and `leading-loose`:

```html
<div class="leading-none">This text has no extra line spacing</div>
<div class="leading-loose">This text has extra line spacing</div>
```

### 5. Font Colors

Add colors to your text using classes like `text-red-500`, `text-blue-700`, and more:

```html
<div class="text-red-500">This text is red</div>
<div class="text-blue-700">This text is blue</div>
<div class="text-green-600">This text is green</div>
```
