# Click Counter - HTML

Let's build something interactive! We are going to make a **Click Counter**.

## The Skeleton

We need a place to show the number and a button to click.

### Code

```html iframe height=10lh showEditor
<h1>Click Counter</h1>

<p>Count: <span id="count">0</span></p>

<button id="click-btn">Click Me!</button>
```

We added `id="count"` and `id="click-btn"`. These IDs act like nametags so JavaScript can find them later!
