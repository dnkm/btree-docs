# HTML - The Skeleton

👋 Welcome to your first step in Web Development!  
We are going to build a simple "Hello World" page using HTML.

## What is HTML?

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that organizes a web page and its content.
Think of it as the **skeleton** of your website.

## Your First HTML Tags

HTML uses "tags" to create elements. A tag generally looks like this:

```html
<tagname>Content</tagname>
```

Let's look at a couple of examples

### Example 1

```html livecodes height=8lh
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is [Name] and I am learning to code!</p>
```

Hit the ▶️ button to run the code and see the result.

Two very common tags are used in this example:

1. `<h1>`: This is a top-level heading (like the title of a book).
2. `<p>`: This is a paragraph (for normal text).

The above code is editable! Change "[Name]" to your actual name and hit "run" to see what happens.

### Example 2

Let's add more content to our page! We can use different heading sizes and even add a button.

```html livecodes height=15lh
<h1>My First Website</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm learning HTML and it's awesome!</p>

<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p>I want to build amazing websites.</p>

<button>Click Me!</button>
```

Notice how we used:

- `<h1>` for the main title
- `<h2>` for section headings (smaller than h1)
- Multiple `<p>` tags for different paragraphs
- `<button>` to create a clickable button

Try changing the text or adding your own sections!

> 🫠 You will be asked to write HTML codes in the upcoming exercises. Make sure you understand the tags and their purposes.
