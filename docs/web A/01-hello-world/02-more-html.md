# Exercise: My Restaurant

Now it's your turn to write some code! let's make a menu item for a restaurant.

## Goal

Create a page for a restaurant dish using headings, paragraphs, and a button.

## Instructions

1. Create an `<h1>` tag with the name of your restaurant (e.g., "Burger Palace").
2. Create an `<h2>` tag with the name of a dish (e.g., "Cheese Burger").
3. Create a `<p>` tag describing the dish (e.g., "A delicious burger with extra cheese.").
4. Create a `<button>` tag that says "Order Now".

## Desired Outcome

```html iframe height=12lh
<h1>Burger Palace</h1>
<h2>Cheese Burger</h2>
<p>A delicious burger with extra cheese.</p>
<button>Order Now</button>
```
