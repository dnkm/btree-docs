# HTML - The Skeleton

Welcome to your first step in Web Development!
We are going to build a simple "Hello World" page.

## What is HTML?

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that organizes a web page and its content.
Think of it as the **skeleton** of your website.

## Your First Tags

HTML uses "tags" to create elements. A tag generally looks like this: `<tagname>Content</tagname>`.

Let's look at two very common tags:

1. `<h1>`: This is a top-level heading (like the title of a book).
2. `<p>`: This is a paragraph (for normal text).

### Example

The following code is editable! Change "[Name]" to your actual name and see what happens.

```html iframe height=10lh showEditor
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is [Name] and I am learning to code!</p>
```
