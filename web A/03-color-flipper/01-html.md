# Color Flipper - HTML

In this project, we will build a tool that changes the background color of the page randomly when you click a button.

## New Concept: Divs

We will use a `<div>`. A `<div>` is like a box or a container. It doesn't do much on its own, but it groups things together so we can style them.

### Structure

```html iframe height=10lh showEditor
<div id="container">
  <h1>Background Color: <span id="color-code">White</span></h1>
  <button id="btn">Click Me</button>
</div>
```

We put everything inside a `div` with `id="container"` so we can center it in the middle of the screen later.
